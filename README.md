# Spatial Recharge Method
Before calculating the CN (https://github.com/lvsantarosa/Spatial-SCS-Curve-Number/tree/main), specific steps must be taken to calculate the potential recharge. Please utilize the provided dataset to test and calculate. 

This method can be applied to the entire country of Brazil using Mapbiomas data set. For global application, modifications to the CN method calculation can be made by utilizing LULC data from MODIS.
